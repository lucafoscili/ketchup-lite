Ketchup Lite is a lightweight and versatile Web Components library designed to enhance your web development experience. It is a fork stemming from the original [Ketchup project](https://github.com/smeup/ketchup), aiming to provide a streamlined and efficient set of tools for developers.

Built with modern standards and best practices in mind, Ketchup Lite offers a collection of reusable components that can seamlessly integrate into any web project, regardless of the framework or vanilla JavaScript setup.

**Use Case Highlight:**  
Display dynamic content, such as photo galleries or portfolio showcases, where items vary in size and need an elegant, responsive layout.

### KulMessenger

![KulMessenger]()

**Description:**  
The **KulMessenger** component provides a customizable interface for interactive roleplay or conversational experiences. Users can define a JSON dataset of characters and initiate conversations through a third-party API (local endpoint required).

**Features:**

- Dynamic list of characters generated from a JSON dataset.
- Interactive chat interface.
- Supports integration with custom LLM endpoints for advanced interactions.
- Configurable visuals and metadata for each character.

**Use Case Highlight:**  
Perfect for creating immersive role-playing experiences, educational tools, or conversational agents where users can interact with pre-defined characters.

**Note:**  
A functional local endpoint is required for chat functionality. If the endpoint is offline, the chat interface will remain static.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To add Ketchup Lite to your project, you can install it via yarn:

```sh
yarn install ketchup-lite
```

### Usage

After installing, you can import and use Ketchup Lite components in your project. Here's a quick example of how to use the `<kul-button>` component:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Ketchup Lite Example</title>
        <script
            type="module"
            src="./path/to/ketchup-lite/dist/index.js"
        ></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <kul-button kul-label="Click me!" />
    </body>
</html>
```

Make sure to replace `./path/to/ketchup-lite/dist/index.js` with the correct path to the `index.js` file in your `node_modules/ketchup-lite` directory.

## Main differences from Ketchup

Ketchup Lite, while sharing a common heritage with the original Ketchup project, has been tailored to cater to specific needs and preferences. Here are some key differences that set Ketchup Lite apart:

- **Lighter**: Ketchup Lite is designed to be significantly lighter, making it an ideal choice for personal websites or smaller projects where performance and load times are critical.

- **Oriented Towards Personal Websites/Projects**: With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, Ketchup Lite is more suited for individual developers or small teams working on personal projects. It offers a streamlined set of features that are easy to implement and maintain.

- **Glassmorphism Look**: Ketchup Lite incorporates a glassmorphism aesthetic throughout its components. This gives a modern, transparent, and sleek appearance to the UI elements, enhancing the visual appeal of personal projects.

- **Absence of the KupObj Concept**: Unlike the original Ketchup, Ketchup Lite does not include the KupObj concept.
- **Absence of FComponents**: Given the library's limited scope, converting its basic components to functional components is unnecessary. If you plan to add thousands of nested web components, it is recommended to stick to the original project.

- **Event Management**: Each component emits a single generic event that encapsulates various actions. Here is an example of how to listen for a button's click event:

```javascript
const myButton = document.querySelector('kul-button');
myButton.addEventListener('kul-button-event', (e) => {
    if (e.detail.eventType === 'click') {
        console.log('Click!');
    }
});
```

## A `Comfy` Marriage

Ketchup Lite forms the backbone of [LF Nodes for ComfyUI](https://github.com/lucafoscili/comfyui-lf), a suite of custom nodes designed for **ComfyUI** workflows. This integration showcases the power and flexibility of web components, making it clear just how effortless it is to introduce new widgets into complex systems.

**Why it works:**

- **Simplicity:** Adding a new widget feels as natural as snapping pieces together.
- **Style:** The sleek design of Ketchup Lite components enhances any workflow.
- **Scalability:** The flexibility of web components ensures seamless integration, even as workflows grow more complex.

Andâ€¦ they look fantastic in action!
